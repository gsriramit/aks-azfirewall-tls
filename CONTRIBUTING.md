Contribution Guidelines
=======================

We love to see contributions to the project and have tried to make it easy to 
do so. If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so 
through GitHub by [forking the repository and sending a pull request](http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/).

If you have a trivial fix or improvement, please create a pull request and 
request a review from a maintainer of this repository.

If you plan to do something more involved, that involves a new feature or 
changing functionality, please first create an [issue](#issues) so a discussion of 
your idea can happen, avoiding unnecessary work and clarifying implementation.

Documentation
-------------

If you contribute anything that changes the behavior of the application, 
document it in the follow places as applicable:
* the code itself, through clear comments and unit tests
* [README](README.md)
* Or a reference in README that points to a more detailed documentation in Ehancements/*featurename.md*

This includes new features, additional variants of behavior, and breaking 
changes.

Testing
-------

There isn't a separate page for tests except for a section in the README file. If adequate amount of tests are being added, then the tests can be grouped under a seprate folder called tests directly under the roor directory

Issues
------

For creating an issue:
* **Bugs:** please be as thorough as possible, with steps to recreate the issue 
  and any other relevant information.
* **Feature Requests:** please include functionality and use cases.  If this is 
  an extension of a current feature, please include whether or not this would 
  be a breaking change or how to extend the feature with backwards 
  compatibility.
* **Security Vulnerability:** please report to a maintainer of this repository

If you wish to work on an issue, please assign it to yourself.  If you have any
questions regarding implementation, feel free to ask clarifying questions on 
the issue itself.

Pull Requests
-------------

* should be narrowly focused with no more than 3 or 4 logical commits
* when possible, address no more than one issue
* should be reviewable in the GitHub code review tool
* should be linked to any issues it relates to (i.e. issue number after (#) in commit messages or pull request message)
